Pipe Dump Utility & Library
===========================

   Pipe Dump is a utility which captures the data sent to STDIN and from
   STDOUT/STDERR of a program.  This is accomplished using fork() and pipe()
   to transmit and receive data from the forked process to the pipe dump
   utility.  Captured data is stored in a file using the libpcap file format.
   This is useful for capturing interactions with commands executed
   from an SSH connection.

Examples
--------

   Command Line
   ------------
      
      $ cat /etc/resolv.conf | pipedump -dd -o file.pcap -- grep \
        -i nameserver


   SSH Authorized Keys
   -------------------

   Pipedump can be inserted into an authorized_keys file to record an SSH
   session.  This is useful for debugging utilities which use SSH for
   authentication and transport such as Gitolite.

   Original Entry:

      ssh-rsa AAAA..ooU= user@host

   Updated Entry:

      command="pipedump -dd -o ssh.pcap -- ${SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND}" ssh-rsa AAAA..ooU= user@host

   Note that the actual RSA key in the above examples has been
   truncated to make the lines easier to read.


   Display libpcap File
   --------------------

   Display payload as hexdump:

       $ tcpdump -qns 0 -X -r file.pcap

   Display payload as ASCII text:

       $ tcpdump -qns 0 -A -r file.pcap
