Pipe Dump Utility & Library
===========================

   Pipe Dump is a utility which captures the data sent to STDIN and from
   STDOUT/STDERR of a program.  This is accomplished using fork() and pipe()
   to transmit and receive data from the forked process to the pipe dump
   utility.  Captured data is stored in a file using the libpcap file format.
   This is useful for capturing interactions with commands executed
   from an SSH connection.
