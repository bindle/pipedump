.SH NAME
pipedump \- Logs the STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR of a program in a CPAP formatted file.

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpipedump\fR [\fB-b\fR \fIlength\fR] [\fB-d\fR] [\fB--verbose\fR | \fB-v\fR] \fB-o\fR \fIfile\fR -- [\fIcommand\fR]
.sp
\fBpipedump\fR [\fB--help\fR | \fB-h\fR] [\fB--version\fR | \fB-V\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBpipedump\fR forks a process and then executes the specified command,
acting as a proxy for \fBSTDIN\fR, \fBSTDOUT\fR, and \fBSTDERR\fR.  Debug data
and data sent to \fBSTDIN\fR are recorded as a IPv6 UDP packets traversing from
\fI::1\fR to \fI::\fR. Data received from \fBSTDOUT\fR and \fBSTDERR\fR are
recorded as a IPv6 UDP packets traversing from \fI::\fR to \fI::1\fR. \fBSTDIN\fR is
recorded as port \fI19840\fR, STDOUT as port \fI19841\fR, \fBSTDERR\fR as port
\fI19842\fR and debug information as port \fI65535\fR. The captured data is
recorded in a file which can be read by network analyzing tools capable of
parsing PCAP files.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-b\fR \fIlength\fR
Allocate a buffer of \fIlength\fR bytes in length. The buffer size limits the
number of bytes read from \fBSTDIN\fR, \fBSTDOUT\fR, \fBSTDERR\fR with each
pass and the maximum payload size of recorded UDP packets.
.TP
\fB-d\fR
Instructs \fBpipedump\fR to record its version number, envrionment variables,
and command to execute to the PCAP log file before executing the command.
.TP
\fB-v\fR, \fB--verbose\fR
Enables verbose messages to be printed to STDERR.
.TP
\fB-o\fR \fIfile\fR
Instructs \fBpipedump\fR to write data to the \fIfile\fR.  If \fIfile\fR already
exists, a PCAP file header is not written and data is appended to the end of the
file.
.TP
\fIcommand\fR
The command any any arguments to be executed by \fBpipedump\fR.
