.SH NAME
pipedump \- Logs the STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR of a program in a CPAP formatted file.

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpipedump\fR [\fB-b\fR \fIlength\fR] [\fB-d\fR[\fBd\fR[\fBd\fR]]] [\fB-p\fR \fIport\fR] [\fB--verbose\fR | \fB-v\fR] \fB-o\fR \fIfile\fR -- [\fIcommand\fR]
.sp
\fBpipedump\fR [\fB--help\fR | \fB-h\fR] [\fB--version\fR | \fB-V\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBpipedump\fR forks a process, executes the specified command, then records
and proxies data from \fBSTDIN\fR to the forked process and data from the forked
process to \fBSTDOUT\fR, and \fBSTDERR\fR. The captured data is recorded in a 
libpcap formatted file which can be read by network analyzing tools such as
\fBtcmpdump (1)\fR and \fBwireshark (1)\fR.
.sp
Data generated by \fBpipedump\fR or written to the forked process (\fBSTDIN\fR)
is recorded as an IPv6 UDP packet transmitted from \fIlocalhost\fR
(\fI::1\fR) to the \fIInternet\fR (\fI::1\fR). Data read from
the forked process (\fBSTDOUT\fR and \fBSTDERR\fR) are recorded as an IPv6 UDP
packet received from the \fIInternet\fR by \fIlocalhost\fR.
.sp
The following source and destination ports are used to specify the type of data
recorded:
.TP
\fB 65535\fR
Version, command string, and command arguments.
.TP
\fB 65534\fR
Environment variables and values.
.TP
\fB 65533\fR
PID of forked process.
.TP
\fB 19840\fR
Data read from \fBSTDIN\fR and written to the forked process's \fBSTDIN\fR.
.TP
\fB 19841\fR
Data read from the forked process's \fBSTDOUT\fR and written to \fBSTDOUT\fR.
.TP
\fB 19842\fR
Data read from the forked process's \fBSTDERR\fR and written to \fBSTDERR\fR.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-b\fR \fIlength\fR
Allocate a buffer of \fIlength\fR bytes in length. The buffer size limits the
number of bytes read from \fBSTDIN\fR, \fBSTDOUT\fR, \fBSTDERR\fR with each
pass and the maximum payload size of recorded UDP packets.
.TP
\fB-d\fR[\fBd\fR[\fBd\fR]]
Record the \fBpipedump\fR version number, command string, and command arguments.
If you use \fB-dd\fR, the PID of the forked command will be recorded. If you use
\fB-ddd\fR, the environment variables will be recorded.
.TP
\fB-v\fR, \fB--verbose\fR
Enables verbose messages to be printed to STDERR.
.TP
\fB-o\fR \fIfile\fR
Instructs \fBpipedump\fR to write data to the \fIfile\fR.  If \fIfile\fR already
exists, a PCAP file header is not written and data is appended to the end of the
file.
.TP
\fB-p\fR \fIport\fR
Instructs \fBpipedump\fR to record \fBSTDIN\fR, \fBSTDOUT\fR, and \fBSTDERR\fR
starting with port \fIport\fR instead of \fI19840\fR.  This option does not
affect the port numbering for debug information.
.TP
\fIcommand\fR
The command any any arguments to be executed by \fBpipedump\fR.
